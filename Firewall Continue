- port scan 
- port forward 
- dmz network 
           - what is port scan? why using it? 
	   port scan is the method used for scan the close port or open port 
most of hacker use this method to find port and service to attack. 
	   
	   - what is the port forward? 
	   port forward is the method of forwarding server port in LAN to public Network. 
	   example: we have public IP: 20.20.20.20 setup this ip on WAN Port of your router. 
	   and you have web server: 192.168.1.2 
           so you can forward port 80 in web server to public ip with port 80 too. example: 20.20.20.20:80 -> forward to 192.168.1.2:80 
so each time they access to public ip 20.20.20.20 it will redirect to private server. 

DMZ Network: DMZ Network is similar to port forward too, but DMZ is forward a whole server to public IP: 
example: web server: 192.168.1.2 
public ip: 20.20.20.20
we can forward ip 20.20.20.20 -> forward to -> 192.168.1.2

who know IP:100 = ? 
         192.168.1.2:80 = ? session 
one ip address can have port 9999 port. 
Standard Operating System have 1024 port by default, (Linux, Android, Windows)
what is standard port in operating system? 
standard port in operating system is the default port that make Operating system such as windows linux android can communicate with each other. 

what is non-standard port? 

non standard port is the port that use range from 1024-9999. 
in general you can change default port to non-standard port it up to you. but make sure your client know the port you changed. 

example: you run web server on port 9999 so you must tell your client to connect to port 9999 not default port 80 as general. 

example: mysql-server running on port 3306 you can change to port 80, but what happen if you have your web server running on port 80 too? 
it will conflict and it not work. that why they dont recommend to change any port to the port from 1-1024. 

and we also need to use port scan tool for scanning open port and close port
open port we can not use another port the same, but close port you can use that port, close port = free port = available port in your Operating System.
